Installation instructions

The WIDS/WIPS framework in its current form as package does not need to be installed. You can use it right after unpacking (just do not alter the package directory structure!!).

If you unpack the package into a directory which is not in the module search path of your Python distribution you must first edit the PYTHONPATH environment variable with

	export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/of/the/package/directory	(e. g. "/tmp/fw_package_1v1")

temporarily on the shell or permanently in your ~/.bashrc file.
